/* For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. */

/* Who are the top ten artists based on popularity? */
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 90
LIMIT 10;

/*Which artists have the most songs on the TOP 50 list?*/
SELECT artist_name, count(track_name) as songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY songs DESC
LIMIT 3;

/*Which artist created the loudest song?*/
SELECT artist_name, track_name, loudness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP by artist_name
ORDER by loudness DESC
LIMIT 1;

/*What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?*/
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 90
LIMIT 10;
